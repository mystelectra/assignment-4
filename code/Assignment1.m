%% Assignment 1

%% Question 1
 % In this simulation, electrons are modeled as they may exist in an N-type
 % semiconductor. A Monte-Carlo model is used to determine the behaviour of
 % the electrons. The effective mass of the electrons is $m_n = 0.26m_0$,
 % where $m_0$ is the rest mass of an electron. Assuming the ambient
 % temperature is 300K, the thermal velocity is $132.24 km/s$. Given a mean
 % free time of $0.2ps$, the mean free path could be expected to be around
 % $26.449\mu m$, where
 %
 % $$ mean free path = \tau_{mn}*v_{th} $$
 %
 % This code, as found below, models 10,000 electrons (as particles) in a
 % region of $200nm$ by $100nm$. In this section, each particle has a fixed
 % velocity based on $v_th$ ad assigned a random direction. The top an
 % bottom boundaries act as perfect reflectors, or specular boundaries,
 % while the left and right boundaries are periodic, maintaining the same
 % number of electrons throughout the simulation. Figure 1 shows the result
 % of the electrons in place within the region, though the motion of an individual electron is
 % difficult to track due to the sheer number of particles in the region.
 % Figure 2 follows the trajectories of several electrons over the course
 % of the simulation, with each electron of the chosen few being assigned a
 % different color.
 %
 % In this portion of the experiment, the temperature of the semiconductor
 % will remain constant. This is because the electrons are not subject to
 % scattering and are not undergoing any change in the magnitude of their
 % velocities, as we will see in the ollowing sections. Figure 3 shows the
 % temperature of the semiconductor remaining constant, as expected, as calculated from the unchanging electron
 % velocities. 

 
 %% Question 2
 % In this section of the simulation, scattering is added to the electron movement (i.e.collisions with the
 % background). A calculation of the mean free path based on scattering, rather than a rough calculation based on given parameters.
 % In this simulation, the scattering is based on the formula:
 %
 % $$ P_{scat} = 1-e^{(-dt/\tau_{mn})} $$
 %
 % This is then compared to a random number generator in MATLab, to
 % simulate the periodicity with which the electrons would scatter in real
 % life, expected to be approximately 5% of the time. In this simulation,
 % when an electron scatters, the electron "re-thermalizes", meaning it is
 % given a new random velocity. The overall distribution of initial
 % velocities for this simulatio nis expected to reflect a
 % Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (i.e. normal distribution), which is
 % affected by including the standard deviation factor of the
 % Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution in the velocity assignment command.
 % Figure 4 shows the distribution of the initial velocities of the
 % electrons. The upper left figure shows the x-axis velocity, the upper
 % right figure shows the y-axis velocity, and the lower figure shows the
 % distribution of the resultant speeds.
 % Figure 5 shows a sample of the electron trajectories, with the
 % individual color assignments. In this simulation, since there is
 % scattering and re-thermalizing, the overall temperature of the
 % semiconductor is not constant, but rather fluctuates with each step in
 % the time loop. Figure 6 shows the instantaneous temperature readings
 % over time, with the most recent reading displayed in the title. The
 % average temperature of the material remains close to the initial value
 % of the material, $T = 300K$.
 %
 % The mean free path and the mean free time are calculated here as well.
 % In an average run, the mean free path will be in the order of magnitude
 % of approximately $2nm$, with a mean free time of approximately $0.13ps$.
 % This is not a huge discrepancy between the assumed values at the
 % beginning, though in the case of the mean free time it is one order of magnitude removed from the assumed value.
 % It is worth noting that exact figures are not included here,
 % as the simulation is based on random elements that will change the final
 % outcome for this parameter with every simulation run.
 
 %% Question 3
% In this final section, we add some insulators to simulate electron motion
% through a barrier. This "bottle-neck" increases the electron activity, in
% terms of velocity changes. In this simulation, all boundaries are
% initialized as specular boundaries, with the exception of the right and
% left boundaries of the full region, which remain periodic. Electrons are
% re-thermalized upon scattering.
% Figure 7 shows the electron activity around the boundaries. Note that no
% electrons are initialized inside the boxes.
% Figure 8 shows the electron density map based on the positions of the
% electrons at the end of the simulation. As expected, it looks completely
% random, and no electrons have made it inside the dielectric "boxes".
% Figure 9 is similar in that it shows a temperature density map of the
% region. This figure takes the magnitude of the final velocies of the
% electrons and uses this value to calculate the temperature of each region
% of the grid. The grid used in this simulation is squares of $5nm$ by
% $5nm$. This yields a density grid of 40 by 20 boxes. Each box is the
% average temperature of the electrons within the box.
% The code for every section of the simulation is included below.
